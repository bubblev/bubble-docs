#### version 2.0.0
Now things are getting wild! Introducing Social Media Inbox, it's time to retake control of your social experience.

Your Bubble will also have better performance, reliability and fault-tolerance, and can route around services that don't like responding to cloud servers.

This will be our first generally-available public release.

*Target Release Date: April 2021*

## What to Expect

### Social Media Inbox
Stop giving personal and behavioral data to big-tech social media companies! With Social Media Inbox, your Bubble will visit the social media services for you and download your feeds.
You can then visit your Social Media Inbox to see what your friends and family are up to. You can like and reply right from your inbox - and YOU decide if that like or reply should be posted back to the social media service, or shared privately
via SMS or email with the other person.

### Multi-node Bubbles
Your Bubble can now run in multiple locations simultaneously. This means:
 * **Better perfomance:** your device will automatically connect to the Bubble with the shortest round-trip network time.
 * **More reliable:** if one of your Bubble nodes has a problem or is unreachable, your devices will automatically try connecting to other nodes in your Bubble.
 * **More flexible:** stopping a Bubble node in one location and restarting it in another will no longer require any downtime, because you'll have other nodes running.

### Flexible Routing
Some services notice that your IP address is in the cloud. For example, Vimeo.com requires Bubble users to complete a CAPTCHA before using the site. Some other services may deny VPN users entirely.

With flex routing, your Bubble can route traffic for certain sites and apps through connected devices at your home (or elsewhere).
You'll still get all the blocking and filtering from your Bubble, and the service will no longer know that you're routing their traffic through your Bubble before it reaches you.
