# Carnival
#### version 3.0.0
Now things are getting wild! Introducing our flagship application: Social Media Inbox.
Retake control of your social experience!

This will be our first generally-available public release.

*Target Release Date: April 2021*

## What to Expect

### Social Media Inbox
Stop giving personal and behavioral data to big-tech social media companies!
With Social Media Inbox, your Bubble will visit the social media services for you and download your feeds.
You can then visit your Social Media Inbox to see what your friends and family are up to.
You can like and reply right from your inbox - and YOU decide if that like or reply should be posted back
to the social media service, or shared privately via SMS or email with the other person.

### Multi-node Bubbles
Your Bubble can now run in multiple locations simultaneously. This means:
 * **Better performance:** your device will automatically connect to the Bubble with the shortest round-trip network time.
 * **More reliable:** if one of your Bubble nodes has a problem or is unreachable, your devices will automatically try connecting to other nodes in your Bubble.
 * **More flexible:** stopping a Bubble node in one location and restarting it in another will no longer require any downtime, because you'll have other nodes running.
