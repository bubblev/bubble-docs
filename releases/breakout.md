# Breakout
#### version 1.0.0
Break through to a new level of personal data security and Internet experience! This will be our expanded beta release.

*Target Release Date: October 2020*

## What to Expect

### Even Faster Launch Time
We're targeting a Bubble launch time under 5 minutes.

### Native Apps
Native apps will be listed in app stores and code-signed for Windows and Mac. Installing the Bubble app will be easier and take fewer steps.

### Nearly all of the Internet "Just Works"
Our cert-pin detection should be fairly complete. It should be rare to find an app that doesn't work properly with Bubble. We'll continue to expand our coverage as we find more apps that require cert-pinning.

### Expanded ShadowBan Support
We'll add ShadowBan support for common social media services: TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, Reddit, LinkedIn, and more.

### ShadowBan Sharing
We'll enable sharing of ShadowBan lists, so Bubble users can subscribe to each other's ban lists and enjoy a better social media experience.

### Expanded Blocking
We will continue to expand our filter coverage to catch more bad stuff.
