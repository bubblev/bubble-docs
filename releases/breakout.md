# Breakout
#### version 2.0.0
Break through to a new level of personal data security and Internet experience! This will be our expanded beta release.

*Target Release Date: April 2021*

## What to Expect

### Even Faster Launch Time
We're targeting a Bubble launch time under 5 minutes.

### Nearly all of the Internet "Just Works"
Our cert-pin detection should be fairly complete. It should be rare to find an app that doesn't work properly with Bubble.
We'll continue to expand our coverage as we find more apps that require cert-pinning.

### ShadowBan Sharing
We'll enable sharing of ShadowBan lists, so Bubble users can subscribe to each other's ban lists and enjoy a better
social media experience.

### Expanded Blocking
We will continue to expand our filter coverage to catch more bad stuff.

### Automatic Updates
Your Bubble can automatically download and install new versions of Bubble.

### What do you want?
Please let us know what you want to see in this Bubble release.
