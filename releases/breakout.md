# Breakout
#### version 2.0.0
Break through to a new level of personal data security and Internet experience! This will be our expanded beta release.

*Target Release Date: December 2020*

## What to Expect

### Even Faster Launch Time
We're targeting a Bubble launch time under 5 minutes.

### App-driven Sign Up
Without first visiting the Bubble website, users can install a Bubble app, sign up and launch a new Bubble right from there.

### Nearly all of the Internet "Just Works"
Our cert-pin detection should be fairly complete. It should be rare to find an app that doesn't work properly with Bubble. We'll continue to expand our coverage as we find more apps that require cert-pinning.

### Expanded ShadowBan Support
We'll add ShadowBan support to even more social media services: TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, Reddit, LinkedIn, and more.

### ShadowBan Sharing
We'll enable sharing of ShadowBan lists, so Bubble users can subscribe to each other's ban lists and enjoy a better social media experience.

### Expanded Blocking
We will continue to expand our filter coverage to catch more bad stuff.

### Flex Routing
Some services notice that your IP address is in the cloud. For example, Vimeo.com requires Bubble users to complete a CAPTCHA before using the site. Some others (like macys.com) may deny VPN users entirely.

With flex routing, your Bubble can route traffic for certain sites and apps through connected devices at your home (or elsewhere).
You'll still get all the blocking and filtering from your Bubble, and the service will no longer know that you're routing their traffic through your Bubble before it reaches you.

### Automatic Updates
Your Bubble can automatically download and install new versions of Bubble.
