* On another device (not your iPhone or iPad):
   * Login to your Bubble
   * Navigate to the Devices screen
   * In the "Add Device" section, enter a name for your iPhone and click or tap the "Add" button to add it.
   * Click or tap "Show VPN connetion info" for your new iPhone device. A QR code will appear.
* On your iPhone or iPad:
   * Install the Wireguard App from the Apple App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wireguard/id1441195209

   * In the Wireguard app, tap "Add a tunnel". If you don't see "Add a tunnel", tap the Plus icon (+) in the top-right corner of the screen.
   * Tap the "Create from QR code" button
   * A camera view will open. Scan the QR code shown on your other device. You'll be asked to provide a name for the tunnel. You can choose anything, but it's probably easiest to use the name of your Bubble.

   * You'll now see your VPN connection listed. Tap the toggle switch to turn it on.
