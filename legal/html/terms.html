(&quot;Bubble&quot;). These Terms also govern the use of and access to Bubble&#39;s content (the &quot;Content&quot;), which includes the Bubble website (the &quot;Site&quot;), applications (the &quot;Apps&quot;), and any software provided by Bubble (the &quot;Software&quot;).</p>
<p>By agreeing to these Terms, you are also agreeing to the Privacy Policy (&quot;Privacy Policy&quot;), which you can <a href="privacy.html">read here</a>.</p>
<h1 id="1-acceptance">1. Acceptance</h1>
<p>By accessing the Content or Services, you are agreeing on behalf of yourself or those you represent (&quot;you&quot;) to comply with and be legally bound by these Terms in their entirety. These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement (the &quot;Agreement&quot;) between you and Bubble. If you do not agree with any part of the Terms, you may not use our Services.</p>
<p>By creating an account for using our Services, you represent that you are at least thirteen (13) years of age, or a valid legal entity, and that the registration information you have provided is accurate and complete.</p>
<h1 id="2-modification">2. Modification</h1>
<p>Bubble may update the Terms from time to time. Bubble will notify you of any significant changes to these Terms via the email address(es) you have associated with your account. If you have no email address associated with your account, you will not be notified of the updated Terms. Bubble will not send notifications for minor changes such as typographical corrections.</p>
<p>If you continue to use Bubble&#39;s Services, Content, Site, Apps, or Software after these changes take effect, then you agree to the revised Terms. The current version of the Terms is available on the Site. You understand and agree that it is your obligation to review these Terms from time to time in order to stay informed on current rules and obligations. Your use of the Content or Services following the changes to these Terms constitutes your acceptance of the changed Terms.</p>
<h1 id="3-privacy-policy">3. Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Bubble is committed to your privacy and does not collect or log browsing history, traffic destination, data content, or DNS queries from Subscribers connected to our Service. During your registration, we may collect some sensitive personal information, such as your email address and payment information. We only collect information that are necessary for the proper delivery of the Site and Services.</p>
<p>For the sake of clarity and transparency, we have placed all information related to data collection in a separate document known as the <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, which is available on the Site. Please review the Privacy Policy in its entirety to get a clear understanding of how we handle your sensitive data.</p>
<h1 id="4-subscriptions">4. Subscriptions</h1>
<p>Bubble Services are available to you upon subscription to the Site. By subscribing to the Services, you agree to become a subscriber (&quot;Subscriber&quot;) for the period you have elected. A full list of subscription plans and pricing is available on the Site. Bubble reserves the right to amend subscription fees or institute new fees at any time upon reasonable advance notice posted on the Site or sent via email. Any changes to the pricing will not affect the Subscriber&#39;s current subscription period and will become effective upon subscription renewal. Subscription purchases and refunds are handled via multiple third-party payment companies.</p>
<p>When supported by your payment method, plans renew automatically by default at the completion of the billing term. By default, the renewal term is for the same duration as the billing term for the original subscription. The subscription fee will be charged automatically to the payment method currently associated with the plan.</p>
<p>There is no charge for the first month of Service for your first plan. If you cancel the Service on your first plan before your first month has elapsed, you owe Bubble nothing and your payment method will not be charged.</p>
<p>You may cancel a Subscription plan at any time. Upon cancellation, Bubble will refund to you a portion of your most recent payment, pro-rated according to how many days of your billing term have elapsed, subject to a minimum of one day.</p>
<p>Each paid subscription grants you one (1) license for your use with an unlimited number of connected devices. Your Bubble allows you to add additional users to your plan, subject to per-plan limits. If you want to use the Services for more users beyond your plan limit, for example for usage by a business, please contact <a href="mailto:licensing@getbubblenow.com">licensing@getbubblenow.com</a>.</p>
<h1 id="5-refund-policy">5. Refund Policy</h1>
<p>Refunds will be considered at the sole discretion of Bubble if the Service was not available or usable during the subscription period and that reasonable attempts were made to contact Bubble to resolve the issue. In this case, Bubble will provide the Subscriber with a pro-rata refund of service fees paid during the period when the Service was not available or usable, rounded up to the nearest US dollar.</p>
<p>Refunds are generally processed within seven (7) days and are made to the original form of payment used for purchase. All refunds are sent in US dollars and therefore the refund amount could differ from the amount originally paid in local currency.</p>
<h1 id="6-acceptable-use-policy">6. Acceptable Use Policy</h1>
<p>Bubble&#39;s Services may be accessed from all around the world; therefore, it is your responsibility to assess whether using the Site, Apps, Software, or Services is in compliance with local laws and regulations.

Your Bubble allows you to install a Secure Shell Key (&quot;SSH key&quot;) which permits a direct terminal login via Secure Shell (&quot;SSH&quot;). When logged in via SSH, it is possible make changes that degrade your plan or render your plan non-functional. In case this happens, Bubble can attempt to remedy the situation but makes no guarantees that your plan can be recovered to its previously functional state. Your sole remedies are to stop and restart your plan, or to delete and recreate your plan. Bubble makes no guarantees that any data or backups associated with your degraded or non-functional plan will survive this recovery process.</p>
