<h1 id="bubble-inc-app-privacy-policy">Bubble Inc. App Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Bubble, Inc. (&quot;Bubble&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;our&quot; or &quot;us&quot;) is committed to protecting your privacy.  We want you to understand what information we collect and what information we do not collect. In addition, we want you to understand how we collect, use, and store your information. This document describes the privacy policy for the Bubble SecurityCloud Application (&quot;App&quot;) that you can install on your device.</p>
<p>The App does not collect logs of your activity, including browsing history, traffic destination, data content, or DNS queries.  We also never collect or store connection logs, or in other words, logs of your IP address, your outgoing VPN address, connection timestamp, or session duration. </p>
<p>We will collect as little data about you as we can and only what is absolutely required to use our service.  We have engineered our system to limit the data that we have about our customers.</p>
<h1 id="personal-information">Personal Information</h1>
<p>The App requires you to enter your email address and password to sign in. We use this email address and password to authenticate your account and sign you in, and for no other purpose.</p>
<p>The App does not collect any other personal information.</p>
<h1 id="error-reporting">Error Reporting</h1>
<p>When your Bubble encounters certain irrecoverable error conditions, you will be asked if you would like to send an error report to a Bubble error receiver. These error reports include the hostname of your Bubble, and may contain log information or stack traces. Error reports will never include passwords, API keys, or other secret information.</p>
