=============================

This Terms of Service document (the "Terms") outlines the terms and conditions of use of the services (the "Services" or "Service") provided by Bubble, Inc. ("Bubble"). These Terms also govern the use of and access to Bubble's content (the "Content"), which includes the Bubble website (the "Site"), applications (the "Apps"), and any software provided by Bubble (the "Software").

By agreeing to these Terms, you are also agreeing to the Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy"), which you can [read here](privacy.md).

# 1. Acceptance

By accessing the Content or Services, you are agreeing on behalf of yourself or those you represent ("you") to comply with and be legally bound by these Terms in their entirety. These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement (the "Agreement") between you and Bubble. If you do not agree with any part of the Terms, you may not use our Services.

By creating an account for using our Services, you represent that you are at least thirteen (13) years of age, or a valid legal entity, and that the registration information you have provided is accurate and complete.

# 2. Modification

Bubble may update the Terms from time to time. Bubble will notify you of any significant changes to these Terms via the email address(es) you have associated with your account. If you have no email address associated with your account, you will not be notified of the updated Terms. Bubble will not send notifications for minor changes such as typographical corrections.

If you continue to use Bubble's Services, Content, Site, Apps, or Software after these changes take effect, then you agree to the revised Terms. The current version of the Terms is available on the Site. You understand and agree that it is your obligation to review these Terms from time to time in order to stay informed on current rules and obligations. Your use of the Content or Services following the changes to these Terms constitutes your acceptance of the changed Terms.

# 3. Privacy Policy

Bubble is committed to your privacy and does not collect or log browsing history, traffic destination, data content, or DNS queries from Subscribers connected to our Service. During your registration, we may collect some sensitive personal information, such as your email address and payment information. We only collect information that are necessary for the proper delivery of the Site and Services.

For the sake of clarity and transparency, we have placed all information related to data collection in a separate document known as the [Privacy Policy](privacy.md), which is available on the Site. Please review the Privacy Policy in its entirety to get a clear understanding of how we handle your sensitive data.

# 4. Subscriptions

Bubble Services are available to you upon subscription to the Site. By subscribing to the Services, you agree to become a subscriber ("Subscriber") for the period you have elected. A full list of subscription plans and pricing is available on the Site. Bubble reserves the right to amend subscription fees or institute new fees at any time upon reasonable advance notice posted on the Site or sent via email. Any changes to the pricing will not affect the Subscriber's current subscription period and will become effective upon subscription renewal. Subscription purchases and refunds are handled via multiple third-party payment companies.

When supported by your payment method, plans renew automatically by default at the completion of the billing term. By default, the renewal term is for the same duration as the billing term for the original subscription. The subscription fee will be charged automatically to the payment method currently associated with the plan.

There is no charge for the first month of Service for your first plan. If you cancel the Service on your first plan before your first month has elapsed, you owe Bubble nothing and your payment method will not be charged.

You may cancel a Subscription plan at any time. Upon cancellation, Bubble will refund to you a portion of your most recent payment, pro-rated according to how many days of your billing term have elapsed, subject to a minimum of one day.

Each paid subscription grants you one (1) license for your use with an unlimited number of connected devices. Your Bubble allows you to add additional users to your plan, subject to per-plan limits. If you want to use the Services for more users beyond your plan limit, for example for usage by a business, please contact [licensing@getbubblenow.com](mailto:licensing@getbubblenow.com).

# 5. Refund Policy

Refunds will be considered at the sole discretion of Bubble if the Service was not available or usable during the subscription period and that reasonable attempts were made to contact Bubble to resolve the issue. In this case, Bubble will provide the Subscriber with a pro-rata refund of service fees paid during the period when the Service was not available or usable, rounded up to the nearest US dollar.

Refunds are generally processed within seven (7) days and are made to the original form of payment used for purchase. All refunds are sent in US dollars and therefore the refund amount could differ from the amount originally paid in local currency.

# 6. Acceptable Use Policy

Bubble's Services may be accessed from all around the world; therefore, it is your responsibility to assess whether using the Site, Apps, Software, or Services is in compliance with local laws and regulations. Whenever you use the Site, Apps, Software, or Services, you should comply with these Terms and applicable laws, regulations, and policies.

You understand that it is your responsibility to keep your Bubble account information confidential. You are responsible for all activity under your account. If you ever discover or suspect that someone has accessed your account without your authorization, you are advised to immediately change all of your account credentials and create new ones.

Bubble aims to provide the best service possible to all of our Subscribers. In that sense, we require that you do not misuse our Content or Services. A misuse refers to any use, access, or interference with the Content or Services contrary to the Terms or applicable laws and regulations.

In order to protect the Services from being misused or used to harm someone, Bubble reserves the right to take appropriate measures when our Services are being used contrary to these Terms and applicable laws. You agree that Bubble may terminate your account, without providing a refund for Services already paid if you misuse the Service.

Your Bubble allows you to add additional users to your plan. Users added to your plan must also agree to these Terms. Any violation of these Terms by any user associated with your plan will be considered a violation of the Terms agreed to by you. Your Bubble allows you to install a Secure Shell Key ("SSH key") which permits a direct terminal login via Secure Shell ("SSH"). When logged in via SSH, it is possible make changes that degrade your plan or render your plan non-functional. In case this happens, Bubble can attempt to remedy the situation but makes no guarantees that your plan can be recovered to its previously functional state. Your sole remedies are to stop and restart your plan, or to delete and recreate your plan. Bubble makes no guarantees that any data or backups associated with your degraded or non-functional plan will survive this recovery process.

We may, at our sole discretion, assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you.

# 13. Choice of Law

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the North Carolina, USA, excluding its rules governing conflicts of law.

# 14. Arbitration

All disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the use of the Site or Services shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration ("Rules") of the International Centre for Dispute Resolution (ICDR) by one arbitrator ("Arbitrator") appointed in accordance with said Rules. The arbitration shall be conducted in North Carolina, USA, unless all parties agree otherwise by a signed written agreement.

The Arbitrator must be qualified and have a background in the area of computer networks, including but not limited to the internet.

The Arbitrator shall have the authority to permit an expedited exchange of documents, but any discovery shall be limited to document requests and interrogatories. The Arbitrator shall have no power or authority to add to or detract from this Agreement, and the costs of the arbitration shall be borne equally, except as described below. The arbitration shall be conducted on an expedited schedule. The arbitration must be concluded, and an award issued, no later than one hundred and twenty (120) days following the filing of the demand for arbitration, unless all parties to the arbitration proceeding agree in writing to an extension of time or continuance.

Subject to any applicable law to the contrary, you agree that any cause of action arising out of or related to the use of our Site or Services must be commenced within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues, or such action will be permanently barred. In the event that Bubble is the respondent in any such arbitration, damages awarded against Bubble may not exceed the amount you have paid Bubble for use of the Service.

The Arbitrator shall have the authority to grant any temporary, preliminary, or injunctive relief in a form substantially similar to that which would otherwise be granted by a court of law. The Arbitrator shall have no authority to award punitive damages. The resulting arbitration award may be enforced, or injunctive relief may be sought, in any court of competent jurisdiction in North Carolina. Reasonable costs (including all costs of arbitration) and attorney's fees shall be awarded against the party that commenced the arbitration, in the event that party does not prevail in the arbitration. The parties subject to this arbitration provision include Bubble, its officers, directors, and employees, and any company or legal entity which is a parent, subsidiary, or sister company to Bubble, or with which Bubble has contracted to provide services to Subscribers through Bubble.

# 15. Final Provisions

If any provision in this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect the original intent of the provision, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Any failure to exercise or enforce any right or the provision of this agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
