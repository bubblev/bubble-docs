Bubble Inc. Privacy Policy
==========================

Bubble, Inc. ("Bubble", "we", "our" or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy.  We want you to understand what information we collect and what information we do not collect. In addition, we want you to understand how we collect, use, and store your information.

We do not collect logs of your activity, including browsing history, traffic destination, data content, or DNS queries.  We also never store connection logs, or in other words, logs of your IP address, your outgoing VPN address, connection timestamp, or session duration. 

We will store as little data about you as we can and only what is absolutely required to use our service.  We have engineered our system to limit the data that we have about our customers.

# General Information

Bubble collects two types of information:

(i) Information related to your account ("personal information")

This information is collected for the purpose of administering your subscription and includes your name, email address, and payment information, which you submit on our order page when you subscribe for the Services.

(ii) Aggregate Apps and VPN connection summary statistics

Bubble collects minimal information about usage in order to maintain excellent customer support and quality of service.  The section below specifies in detail what information we collect.  These statistics never include anything about what the user did with the VPN, or in other words, no data about the contents or destination of VPN traffic, no DNS queries, and no IP addresses.

# Personal Information

Bubble collects personal information that you provide to us directly through the Site.  We require that you provide personal information, such as an email address and payment information, in order to establish a Bubble account, and so that we can email you, collect payments, and respond to support questions that you initiate.  The specific information collected varies depending on the payment method you choose.

With some forms of payment, the Site may redirect you to the website of a third-party payment processor (namely PayPal or Stripe) to complete the transaction.  To understand what personal information these processors collect and store, please refer to the respective processor's terms and privacy policies. Bubble will never store your actual credit card information or other payment information; this information is all handled by the payment processor.

Bubble uses your email address for the following reasons:

To send emails related to payment transactions;
To provide links to our Site, including password reset emails;
To send you updates and announcements, including to inform you of updates to the Privacy Policy;
To communicate with you about your VPN services or respond to your communications;
To send marketing information, such as Bubble VPN offers, surveys, invitations, and content about other matters in connection with Bubble VPN ("Marketing emails").

All marketing mailing lists are opt-in, you will never be automatically added to any list. You have to affirmatively check a box to join a marketing mailing list. You may choose to not receive Marketing emails by following the opt-out procedure described in these emails.  All Marketing emails will include an unsubscribe link.  Marketing emails from Bubble will be limited to one per month, except in rare cases where a correction to a previous email must be made.

Bubble uses your personal information only for the purposes listed in this Privacy Policy, and we will not sell, rent, or otherwise grant any access to your personal information to third parties.

# Aggregate Apps and VPN Connection Summary Statistics

We ensure that we never log browsing history, traffic destination, data content, IP addresses, or DNS queries.  Therefore:

We do not know when a user accessed a particular website or service;
We do not know the original IP address of a user's computer.

Should anyone try to compel Bubble to release any of the above information, we cannot supply it because the data does not exist.

In order to maintain excellent customer support and quality of service, Bubble VPN collects the following information related to your VPN usage.

### Bubble Running/Not Running Status

We monitor your Bubble to understand when it is running or not running. We use this information for billing purposes and to ensure proper operation of your Bubble.

### Data Transfer

We collect information regarding the total sum of data transferred by a given user for each billing period.  Although we provide unlimited data transfer, if we notice that a user consumes a disproportionately large amount of data we reserve the right to charge one hundredth of one US Dollar ($0.01 USD) for each GB transferred beyond your plan's limit within a single month.

### Cloud Service Requests

Your Bubble may use cloud services, for example cloud storage, email, or geolocation, that are routed through an upstream Bubble, typically the Bubble that was used to launch your Bubble. The upstream Bubble retains these messages for a short cache period to ensure the proper cloud service interaction has been taken and to avoid sending unnecessary and/or duplicate requests.

### Opt-In Error Reporting

If you have opted-in to Bubble Error Reporting, then when your Bubble encounters certain irrecoverable error conditions, an error report will be sent to a Bubble error receiver. These error reports include the hostname of your Bubble, and may contain log information or stack traces. Error reports will never include passwords, API keys, or other secret information.

### Opt-In Performance Monitoring

If you have opted-in to Bubble Performance Monitoring, then your Bubble will periodically send performance data and other metrics to a Bubble data receiver. This information will include the hostname of your Bubble, along with other system metrics and data. Examples of metrics we collect: system CPU, memory and disk levels, request rates, and error rates.

Error Reporting and Performance Monitoring services help Bubble to provide better technical support to you. With these services enabled, Bubble can identify and fix issues faster. These services also enable Bubble to offer you well-informed advice on best-practices for using your Bubble.

# Storing of Information Related to Email, Live Chat, Blog Posts, and Feedback Forms

Bubble keeps records of correspondence, questions, complaints, or compliments you submit to us through our Site or Services, along with our response.  Depending on how you contact Bubble, we may collect your email address and any additional information you provide to us.  Having full correspondence records enables our Support Team to provide the best possible customer experience. At your request, or upon deletion of your account, we will delete all of this information.

Other users who have permission to view any of your content may copy it. They may also further modify that content to create their own versions.

Other users never have access to your email address or any of your account registration information (other than your nickname), unless you give them that information directly without involvement from Bubble.
