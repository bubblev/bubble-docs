# Bubble Fun Guide
Here are some fun things your Bubble makes possible

 * Enhanced Privacy
 * Social Media Filtering
 * Analytics

## Enhanced Privacy
Your Bubble is blocking a lot of behavior trackers, ads and ad networks, malware and lots more.

We have enabled feedback on blocking on a select number of sites. For example:

### Exercise 1 - view block statistics
Navigate to a mainstream news website, for example https://nytimes.com/

In the bottom-right corner, you will see a "stop sign" icon -- that's BlockParty in action!

The color of the stop-sign icon will be green if nothing nefarious was blocked, yellow if there was some blockable stuff, and red if there was a lot.

You can click or tap on the icon to see what was blocked.

## Social Media Filtering
Your Bubble brings user-blocking and keyword filters to many social media and discussion sites.

**NOTE** these features will **not** work in native apps, you must use the web version of the service.

### Exercise 2 - clean up your Facebook feed
Navigate to https://facebook.com/

In the bottom-right corner, you will see a "block user" icon -- that's ShadowBan in action!

Next to every username, there is a block-user button. Click or tap this to block that user.

Click or tap the ShadowBan icon in the bottom-right to see more ShadowBan options.

Click or tap the "Keyword Lists" section to see different keyword lists that are available.

Click or tap the checkboxes to select the "US News Media" and "US Politics" lists, then press "Close"

Scroll through your feed for a bit, then tap the ShadowBan icon in the bottom-right.

Click or tap the "Recent Blocks" section to see what's been blocked.

Note your "signal/noise" ration -- this lower this is, the more stuff had to be blocked.

## Analytics
Your Bubble can show you what sites your devices have been talking to.

### Exercise 3 - anything look funny?
Navigate to the "Snitcher" app on your Bubble:
  * In one of your native apps, you can click the "My Account" icon
  * This opens a browser window to your account on your Bubble
  * In the navigation menu, choose "Apps", then click on the "Snitcher" app
  * Click or tap "Recent Traffic"

Use a native app that you think might (or might not) be doing something shady.

Refresh the Snitcher "Recent Traffic" view -- it should show details about any network requests your device just made while using the app.

If you see something funny, let us know!
