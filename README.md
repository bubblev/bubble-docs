Why Bubble?
===========

When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for the People to dissolve the political and technological bands which have connected them to Surveillance Technology, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of humankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all humans are created equal, that they possess certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, the pursuit of Happiness, and a reasonable Expectation of Privacy in their thoughts and activities. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted by the People, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, or is impotent in preventing the usurpation of these Rights by Surveillance Technology, it is the Right of the People to secure these Rights for themselves, laying a new foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety, Happiness, and Privacy. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that these necessary but difficult steps should not be undertaken for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that humankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by adopting new forms to which they may secure their Liberties. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Surveillance Technology, and to provide new Guards for their future security.

Bubble is a new kind of VPN, loaded with features to give YOU more control over your Internet experience.

## The Age of Surveillance Capitalism is upon us.
Big Technology has armed itself with Big Data, Machine Learning, Behavioral Analytics, and myriad other technologies; all designed to maximize profits by watching your every move, knowing your most intimate thoughts, and selling that data on the open market to the highest bidder. We find this incredibly creepy and ultimately unhealthy for society. In the battle between mere humans and the tech behemoths, you cannot even call it "David versus Goliath" -- at least David had a slingshot! Let Bubble be your slingshot.

## The Age of Information Overload is upon us.
The signal-to-noise ratio has gone from bad to worse to the hellscape that is online media today. Separating truth from fiction has become increasingly difficult; this difficulty is intentionally exacerbated by those who stand to profit from it. For many, truth has become opinion, and opinion has become truth. We find this destructive of rational discourse and ultimately unhealthy for society.

Bubble stands firmly against Surveillance Capitalism, against Information Overload, and against everything that is destructive of a healthy democratic society and our individual liberties.

Bubble stands firmly in favor of leveling the playing-field with the Technology Goliaths. Bubble stands for giving all humans the power to protect themselves and their families from the Surveillance Technology being used against us, against our will.
